# dotfiles

```bash
$ ~/.*
```
You know I had to do it like all the cool kids :sunglasses:.

**Warning** Be careful when using the commands used in e.g. `install/.macdefaults`. Only use these
commands if you know what the effects will be.

### Structure
```bash
bash/                 # Aliases, functions and my prompt (and more)
bin/                  # Some scripts I (sometimes) use
editors/              # config and style files for editors: Atom, Nano and Vim
git/                  # gitconfig: useful git aliases and other settings
install/              # .macdefaults, Brew, Cask, Pip and Atom packages
terminals/            # Hypers config file and style file for Terminal.app
```

### Usage
download or clone this repository to wherever you want. Then:
```bash
$ cd path/to/dotfiles
$ bash /install/dot <args>
```
If you need a little help:
```bash
$ bash dot --help
```
